# CIT 141 Intro to Programming C++
It's been several weeks since I learn my first college-level programming course. Here's some reflection. 

## Self-studying most of the time
I feel the class pace is quite slow, so that I usually study slides ahead and practice on Visual Studio Code and review syntax on [Web3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [Freecodecamp]([https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/c-plus-plus/](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp)).

### Week 1 - Week 6:
During this time, I learned about C++ syntax, familiarized myself with control structures, user-defined functions, and some typical C libraries (iostream, cmath, iomanip, etc.) 

The most essential thing I learned was about functions: 
  - How to declare a function? How to organize the function's declaration and definition
  - Void and value-returning functions
  - Default and multiple parameters functions
